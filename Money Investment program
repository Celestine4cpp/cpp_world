/*Write a program that calculates how much money youâ€™ll end up with if you invest anamount of money at a fixed interest rate, compounded yearly. Have the user furnish theinitial amount, the number of years, and the yearly interest rate in percent. Some interac-tion with the program might look like this:Enter initial amount: 3000Enter number of years: 10Enter interest rate (percent per year): 5.5At the end of 10 years, you will have 5124.43 dollars.Loops and Decisions3LOOPS ANDDECISIONS12704 3087 CH03  11/29/01  2:18 PM  Page 127
At the end of the first year you have 3000 + (3000 * 0.055), which is 3165. At the end ofthe second year you have 3165 + (3165 * 0.055), which is 3339.08. Do this as manytimes as there are years. A forloop makes the calculation easy.
